# ðŸ““ Lesson 04: Automatic image optimization with Cloudinary Netlify Plugin

Now that we're set up on Netlify, we want to start working towards our goal of optimizing all of our static assets.

And because we're on Netlify, this is easy to do. Netlify allows plugins into it's build process (build plugins) allowing services or really anyone to hook in and do some additional work.

That's exactly what's happening with the [Cloudinary Netlify Plugin](https://github.com/colbyfayock/netlify-plugin-cloudinary), where by enabling it with our Cloudinary account, we can get automated optimization for all our images.

## Getting Started

First things first, before we dive into the plugin we'll need a Cloudinary account. Hopefully at this point you already have an account set up, but if you don't, be sure to head over to [cloudinary.com/users/register/free](https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free)

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: When selecting a Cloudinary product during account creation, be sure to select Programmable Media!

With our Cloudinary account, we can install the plugin right inside the UI, where once configured with our Cloudinary account, we'll be on our way to automatic image optimization!

## Objectives
* Install and configure the Cloudinary Netlify Plugin
* Create a Netlify file-based configuration for the plugin
