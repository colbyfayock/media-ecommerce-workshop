# The End

Congrats ðŸ¥³ you did it!

We just learned how to level up our online store and web apps using Cloudinary.

## What did we learn?

If you followed along every step of the way, you should now have quite a bit of experience under your belt including:

* Spinning up a new Next.js app from scratch
* Deploying it to Netlify
* Automatically optimizing all images with the Cloudinary Netlify Plugin
* Uploading images to Cloudinary and delivering them with the JS URL Gen SDK
* Using Cloudinary with Next.js
* And even trying out a new experimental Cloudinary Next.js Component

## What's next?

Cloudinary has a huge range of features you can now take advantage of which you can learn more about in the [Cloudinary Docs](https://cloudinary.com/documentation).

You can also check out more tutorials from me over at [spacejelly.dev](https://spacejelly.dev/search/?q=cloudinary) or [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/colbyfayock/search?query=cloudinary).
